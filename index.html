      <h2>Legal Researcher⚖️</h2>
          <p> Legal nerd at heart, nothing brings me more joy than trying to solve a legal puzzle. Although, this joy is severely diminished when reading a 50 odd page judgement and all the judges are <strong>practically saying the same thing </strong> (just say you agree with your colleague and let us all be going).</p>

       <h2>Gallivanter🗺️</h2>
          <p> Deciding to heed the (unintentional) advice from a number of professionals I spoke to during networking events during my uni days, I decided to take a gap year after uni. </p>

          <p> What started out as just going where the wind (read: my bank account) took me, developed into me wanting to fill all 20 gaps in the country tracker table I drew in my bullet journal. Somewhere between country 5 and 20, the travel bug hit hard and transformed a gap year activity into my ultimate (and most expensive) hobby. </p>

        <h2>Powerlifter🏋🏾‍♀️</h2>
          <p> What started out as simply accompying my friend to a powerlifting taster session at uni has turned into my new hobby/the only thing getting me into the gym. Granted, I've spent most of my powerlifting career (if you'd call it that) bouncing between PB's and injuries, but one day the stars and moons will align, my back will remain intact and will get my British deadlift record. One day.</p>

        <h2>Doughnut Snob🍩</h2>
          <p>Doughnuts truly make the world go round (and you for that mattter after one too many).</p>

          <p>Now, I don't have many requests in this life, but I do request (read: insist) that my doughnuts be bougie. Therefore, Supermarket doughnuts need not apply. Life is too short for bad doughnuts (especially during a global pandemic).</p>

              After experiencing the best burger I have ever tasted in Zagreb, Crotia in 2017, my quest to find the best burger of all time began. It's 2020 at the time of writing, and only one burger has ever come close.
